# Automated Software Engineering Journal Companion Site
{: .fs-9 }

<img width=300 align=right src="/img/logo.png">

This journal welcomes papers where (a) software engineering tasks
are being explored (in some non-trivial manner); and (b) the activity
being automated (or semi-automated) is too complex for manual
analysis (given reasonable resource constraints). For example, a
manual requirements engineering method would not be acceptable here.
On the other hand, what could be acceptable would be a novel tool
(e.g.  automatic natural language analysis) that supports that
requirements engineering process.
