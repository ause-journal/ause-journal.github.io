Type | Length| Content | Notes
----|--------|---------|------
Technical paper | 10+ pages (usually less than 50) | Motivation + methods  +  new results | Archival records of completed research, usually with an  evidence-based evaluation of hypotheses (e.g experiments on some SE-related data with a statistical analysis).   
Industrial paper | 3+ pages (usually less than 50)| | E.g. reports an early prototype or deployed version of an automated software engineering task, or experiences/challenges during the deployment of such automation.
Literature review | 10+ pages (usually less than 50) | Motivation + methods + summary of old results  | Merely describing prior work is not  enough. Literature reviews should identify gaps in prior work and propose ways to address that gap. Exceptional literature reviews actually perform some of those experiments..
Vision statement | 3-8 pages | Motivation | A carefully stated opinion, perhaps yet without supporting experimentation. For example, see “Edgar Dijkstra: Go To Statement Considered Harmful”, https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf
Registered report (initial) | 3+ pages (usually less than 50) | Motivation + method | Documenting  formative research ideas and an hypothesis, perhaps without a longer investigation -  these should include motivation and a proposed analysis method.  Ideally, registered reports are followed up by a registered results paper. |
Registered results<br>(followup) | 10+ pages (usually less than 50) | Short summary of (Motivation + method) then new results | This is the second part of a “registered report” paper.  Registered reports  can be explorative (of new ground) or confirmative (i.e. checking a prior result). For exploratory studies,  updating the  hypothesis after seeing new results is allowed, providing that update is made  is a principled manner (using some principle process).
Tutorial | 3+ pages (usually less than 50) | Method (not new results) | Tutorials (a) need to be based on  “available” material  (as defined in the “Open Science” section, above).  Such papers need to (b) review the research area addressed by some tool/ algorithm/ technique/   data set and (c) suggest a list of significant open issues  that could be  addressed with the tool or data set. Tutorials are evaluated  according to their potential to enable future work.
Tool (or data set) report | 3-8 pages | Method (not  new results) | Short report offer some notes on a  some reusab;e tool/ artifact/ data set describing , along with open issues with that   tool or data set that could be explored further .  Tool reports are evaluated  according to their potential to enable future work.
Errata | 3-8 page |s Text | Fixing some misstatements in a prior publication.
