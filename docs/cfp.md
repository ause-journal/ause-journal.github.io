# Call for papers
{: .fs-9 }


<img src="/img/venn.png" align=right width=450>

Standard journal papers include **motivation**, **method**, and **results**. 

AUSE journal papers are usually the same but, as shown below, can contain zero or more
**motivation**, **methods**, and **results** sections.

For example:

- a _standard technical paper_ contains **motivation** and **method**  and **results**;
- a _vision statement_ may contain only **motivation** statements;
- a _registered report_ contains just **motivation** and **method**;
- a _tools paper_ may be just **method** (without, say, **results**);
- etc

So check the list below-- maybe you can find the kind of paper you always wanted to write!

{: .important }  
> As of Dec 2024, the following two special rules will apply. <br>(1) Submissions are no longer allowed, generated from Msword (submit pdfs generated from the
[Springer Latex template files](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/18782940/data/v11)). For authors unfamilar with Latex, we use and recommend the on-line tool [http://overleaf.com](overleaf.com). <br>
(2) Use of the NASA data sets from the 1990s (PC1, JM1, etc) is no longer acceptable. Please use tools like (e.g.) CommitGuru to mine (e.g.) Github to find data.

{: .warning }
> If you are **not** submitting a standard _technical paper_ (as defined below), it is strongly recommeded you add the name of the paper type
to the **front** of your title within your paper; e.g. "_**Industrial Paper**: Insights from Three Years of Static Code Analysis_"
(otherwise, we may accidently apply the wrong review criteria).

<tr><td>Technical paper </td><td> 10+ pages (usually less than 50) </td><td> Motivation + methods  +  new results </td><td> Archival records of completed research, usually with an  evidence-based evaluation of hypotheses (e.g experiments on some SE-related data with a statistical analysis).   </td></tr>
<tr><td>Industrial paper </td><td> 3+ pages (usually less than 50)</td><td> </td><td> E.g. reports an early prototype or deployed version of an automated software engineering task, or experiences/challenges during the deployment of such automation.</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #CCCCCC;"><td>Literature review </td><td> 10+ pages (usually less than 50) </td><td> Motivation + methods + summary of old results  </td><td> Merely describing prior work is not  enough. Literature reviews should identify gaps in prior work and propose ways to address that gap. Exceptional literature reviews actually perform some of those experiments..</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vision statement </td><td> 3-8 pages </td><td> Motivation </td><td> A carefully stated opinion, perhaps yet without supporting experimentation.  For example, see <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Edgar Dijkstra: Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>.<p>For more details,
see the <a href="futures.html">futures</a> page. </p> </td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #CCCCCC;"><td>Futures paper</td><td>3+ pages</td><td>  </td><td> These are particular kinds of invited vision statements (see <a href="futures.html">Future's page</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Registered report (initial) </td><td> 3+ pages (usually less than 50) </td><td> Motivation + method </td><td> Documenting  formative research ideas and a hypothesis, perhaps without a longer investigation -  these should include motivation and a proposed analysis method.  Ideally, registered reports are followed up by a registered results paper. For more on registered reports, see <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/about">About registered reports</a></td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #CCCCCC;"><td>Registered results<br>(followup) </td><td> 10+ pages (usually less than 50) </td><td> Short summary of (Motivation + method) then new results </td><td> This is the second part of a “registered report” paper.  Registered reports  can be explorative (of new ground) or confirmative (i.e. checking a prior result). <p><b>IMPORTANT POINT:</b> For exploratory RR studies at this journal,  updating the  hypothesis after seeing new results is allowed, providing that update is made  in a principled manner (i.e. where that update method is pre-specified in the initial report).</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>Tutorial </td><td> 3+ pages (usually less than 50) </td><td> Method (not new results) </td><td> Tutorials (a) need to be based on  “available” material  (as defined in the “Open Science” section, above).  Such papers need to (b) review the research area addressed by some tool/ algorithm/ technique/   data set and (c) suggest a list of significant open issues  that could be  addressed with the tool or data set. Tutorials are evaluated  according to their potential to enable future work.</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color: #CCCCCC;"><td>Tool (or data set) report </td><td> 3-8 pages </td><td> Method (not  new results) </td><td> Short report offer some notes on a  reusable tool/ artifact/ data set describing , along with open issues with that   tool or data set that could be explored further.  Tool reports are evaluated  according to their potential to enable future work.</td></tr>
