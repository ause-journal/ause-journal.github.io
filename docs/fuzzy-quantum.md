# CFP: Implications of Fuzzy techniques for developing quantum software systems
{: .fs-9 }

There are multiple applications of fuzzy techniques methods and concepts which can be used in
software engineering projects in industry and research. Fuzzy techniques are used for many
conventional applied software engineering challenges including defect prediction, estimation and
reusable software engineering and classification. However, the applications of fuzzy techniques
in developing quantum software system are not yet considered and further investigation is
required in their suitability in the domain of quantum software practices. The modern-day
conventional Fuzzy techniques can be used to engineer a quantum software system.
This issue will provide an opportunity to present the empirical evidence and technical strategies
for developing the quantum software, as well propose new techniques, tools, frameworks, and
approaches to maximize the significance of quantum software with the application of conventual
fuzzy techniques. We welcome the articles where the authors report research studies for the
applications of fuzzy techniques in the domain of software processes.

Papers in the field of
applied computing for quantum software engineering on (but not limited to) the following topics
are invited for submission:

- State-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of fuzzy techniques for quantum software engineering.
- Systematic literature reviews and mapping studies on quantum software engineering and fuzzy techniques.
- Case studies, surveys, observational studies, delphi studies, and field studies on fuzzy techniques and quantum applications.
- Fuzzy techniques for decision support system.
- Validation and simulation.
- Industrial findings and experience reports of developing quantum software.
- Fuzzy techniques for development environments, frameworks, and tools.
- Fuzzy techniques for quantum process improvement.
- AI for quantum software process management.
- Managing agile based quantum software process using fuzzy techniques concepts.
- Process risks management using fuzzy techniques.
- Quantum software process simulation modelling.
- Data science for quantum process management.
