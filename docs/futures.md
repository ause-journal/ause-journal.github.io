# Call for papers, Future's Track
{: .fs-9 }

- A future's paper is an invited "vision statement" about the future of software engineering in a special collection called "the future"
  - A carefully stated opinion, perhaps yet without supporting experimentation. For example, see 
    [Edgar Dijkstra: Go To Statement Considered Harmful](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf). 
- 3 pages minimum, 8 pages max ( by invitation  from an Associated Editor_
  - (Non-invited authors may submit a 1 page proposal of what they might say).

{: .warning }
> We caution Ph.D. students that "futures" does not mean "Ph.D. prospectus"; i.e. it does **not** mean as-yet-undeveloped preliminary notes. Rather, a Futures paper should be based on extensive experience with some area.

## Review Criteria

Authors of futures papers should apply the following checklist before submission.

- [ ] Is the work relevant to software engineering? (Mandatory)
- [ ] Is the paper 3-8 pages long?
- [ ]  Is the paper current and timely? (We don’t really want to publish something that could  have been written 5,10 years ago)
- [ ] Is it a useful vision:? (Essential requirement)
- [ ] Is it a breathtaking vision? (Optional, but desirable).
- [ ] Is it a useful vision? i.e.
  - Does it list relevant work ?
  - Does it offer numerous open challenges?
  - Does it rank challenges most to least pressing?
- [ ] Does it miss anything that would be useful to add ? (But don’t go crazy on this one— don’t want these papers to get too long).
  - e.g. what are the key over/under-researched areas to date?
  - e.g. what are real-world ASE deployments to date/needed in future?
  - e.g. the usual suspects: security, open science, ethics, LLMs, etc
- [ ] In the writing, are there any anti-patterns?
  - Is the paper short (Definitely less than 9, ideally less than 5  pages. This is an  optional requirement but short and to the point is better);
  - Is there some  IMPORTANT paragraph buried in the body (when it really should be on p1)?
