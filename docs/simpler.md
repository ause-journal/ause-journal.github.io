# Call for papers, Less is More

> Submissions to this track must be situated in the SE literature and  come with a cover letter stating that they wish to be reviewed as "less is more" paper.

Throughout the years, there have been numerous accounts of very basic models that have achieved remarkable results [^am] [^ho] [^ko] [^me] [^ta] [^za], and that such simpler models are essential for people to understand a subject [^pi]. So where are the researchers inquiring ``could this imply that we can make software analytics simpler and easier to comprehend?''

We are proposing the creation of a platform where researchers can openly discuss the idea that some of our methods are overly-complex and that simpler approaches can be just as effective. This call is ongoing and we are looking for papers that; e.g.

- Re-examine existing results and demonstrate how task A can be better performed by a simpler method (e.g. smaller, faster, etc.).
- We are also interested in ablation studies that remove parts of an implementation until performance drops;
- Instance or feature selection methods to reduce the training set;
- Distillation methods to reduce the size of a learned model;
- Variance studies that show that the improvement of a complex method over a simpler one is insignificant;
- Studies that show that a 10% system can perform as well as a 100% system.
- Semi-supervised learning methods that let us do much more with much less data;

and any other kind of study that illustrates when less can be more.
