# Call for papers: A Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence for Integrated Development Environments (AI-IDE)
{: .fs-9 }

With the rapid evolution of intelligent programming assistants and LLM-based agents, there is a pressing need to discuss design methodologies, integration strategies, and the future trajectory of AI in software development tools. We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to submit their original contributions to the ASE Special Issue on AI-IDE. The special issue aims to bring together professionals from academia and industry to explore the latest advancements, challenges, and solutions in the field of AI-Powered IDEs.

## Aims and Scope

We welcome papers that cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- AI-enhanced software development, e.g. code completion and project generation
- Integration of large language models in IDEs
- Intelligent testing, debugging and error detection tools
- AI-driven code refactoring and optimization
- Human-AI collaboration in software development
- User experience design for AI-powered development tools
- Ethical, privacy and security considerations in AI-assisted programming
- Case studies and empirical evaluations of AI IDEs
