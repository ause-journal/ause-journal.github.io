## Desk Rejects

Many papers are not sent on to review for the following four reasons:

1. Not situated in se domain; e.g.  the paper makes no reference to papers from the 
    [SE mainstream](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems)?
2. Paper lacks evaluation against some prior state of the art result.
3. Paper does not have a significant automation component.
   - But we are  a little light handed with this one since papers might (e.g.) be offering a new result in a previously unexplored area.
3. Paper does not satisfy the requirements of a (e.g. )technical paper as stated in [https://ause-journal.github.io/cfp.html](https://ause-journal.github.io/cfp.html). Paper might be more suitable to resubmit this as a (e.g.) tools paper
Note that to do #3 properly we need to know the intent of the authors (what kind of paper they thought they were submitting). Authors can supply
that intent in the paper  title OR cover letter . Also note that this point might lead to major revision, not rejection.

As to other principles of desk rejects:

-  Be open to out of the box. Sometimes (ocassionaly) we find gems there that mean we should junk all our rules and take a paper since it is  cool.
