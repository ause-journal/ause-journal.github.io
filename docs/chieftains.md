## Special Issues 

ASE Journal welcomes proposals for guest edited special issues. If you wish to propose a special issue, please first contact one of the associate editors to review your proposal, provide feedback, and be willing to support your special issue proposal for consideration by the Editorial Board. Please see our list of AEs at [https://link.springer.com/journal/10515/editors](https://link.springer.com/journal/10515/editors). Please contact one of them directly, ideally someone who works in the area of your special issue proposal.

Special issue proposals should
- be clearly in the scope of the ASE journal - [https://link.springer.com/journal/10515/aims-and-scope](https://link.springer.com/journal/10515/aims-and-scope)
- demonstrate promise in attracting a good range of submissions to the special issue
- allow a range of submission types e.g. full research paper, short research paper, review paper, tool paper, vision paper etc.
- provide an avenue for publication of strong research contributions within the special issue theme that otherwise currently might not have a suitable venue

Only proposals certified by one of the members of the associate editorial board will be considered for a special issue of the journal.

## Desk Rejects

Many papers are not sent on to review for the following four reasons:

1. Not situated in se domain; e.g.  the paper makes no reference to papers from the 
    [SE mainstream](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems)?
2. Paper lacks evaluation against some prior state of the art result.
3. Paper does not have a significant automation component.
   - But we are  a little light handed with this one since papers might (e.g.) be offering a new result in a previously unexplored area.
3. Paper does not satisfy the requirements of a (e.g. )technical paper as stated in [https://ause-journal.github.io/cfp.html](https://ause-journal.github.io/cfp.html). Paper might be more suitable to resubmit this as a (e.g.) tools paper
Note that to do #3 properly we need to know the intent of the authors (what kind of paper they thought they were submitting). Authors can supply
that intent in the paper  title OR cover letter . Also note that this point might lead to major revision, not rejection.

As to other principles of desk rejects:

-  Be open to out of the box. Sometimes (ocassionaly) we find gems there that mean we should junk all our rules and take a paper since it is  cool.
