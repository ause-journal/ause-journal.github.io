# Call for papers, Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps, 2024
{: .fs-9 }

This special issue will conclude outputs of the Dagstuhl seminar:
https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24161

This interactive seminar therefore brings the computer science and
software engineering research community and the research software
engineering community together to define a common language, and apply
it to improve reciprocal knowledge transfer, beginning with five key
topics:

- Effective specification of the requirements of research software in
different application and research disciplines.
- Design, modeling, implementation, operation, reproducibility and
maintenance of research software based on the current state of the art
in computer science, and specifically (research) software engineering.
- Formal and informal education and training of RSEs in
state-of-the-art software engineering research and community building,
and vice versa, the provision of better access for the software
engineering research community to the problems and challenges that
research software engineers face in practice.
- Tackling the challenges of increasingly complex domain problems,
data, and software while operating under the resource constraints in
current research ecosystems.
- Generalizing the diversity of opinions, experiences, and practices
of research software engineering to successfully inform and influence
computer science research.

Initialized by select input talks, participants from the different
communities will work interdisciplinarily in dynamic breakout groups
to discuss the issues at hand, identify potential solutions, and
initiate common research programmes. A goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar
is that the outcomes be drafted as chapters for a research software
engineering field manual.
