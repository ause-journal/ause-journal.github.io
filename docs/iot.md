# Call for papers, Data generation in IoT
{: .fs-9 }

In any IoT system, the generation of massive volumes of data is a common occurrence due to the
interconnected nature of devices and sensors. Efficient data generation practices involve the
development of software solutions that enable streamlined data collection, processing, and
transmission. This involves implementing robust data acquisition mechanisms that attach to the
standard of industry standards and other protocols.One of the key features of software engineering
practices for efficient data generation is the use of optimized data collection methodologies. These
methodologies involve employing lightweight protocols and data compression techniques to reduce
the size of data transmitted across the IoT network. Minimizing the amount of data transferredcan
enhance network efficiency and also reduces latency by conserving resources.

Beyond efficient data collection and storage, software engineering practices encompass data
processing and analytics. Through the use of scalable and distributed computing frameworks like
Apache Spark or Hadoop to analyse the vast quantities of generated data promptly. In turn, this
empowers us to extract real-time insights, detect anomalies and perform predictive analytics enabling
data-driven decision-making and boosting system performance.As the IoT landscape continues to
evolve software engineering practices need to adapt to emerging technologies and standards.
Continuous research and development in this field are essential to address the evolving challenges and
complexities associated with efficient data generation in IoT systems.The Special Issue aims to
provide a platform to professionals working in this area for sharing knowledgeand insights to advance
the state of the art in this field. We welcome them to submit studies that propose novel algorithms,
methodologies, frameworks, or practical approaches to optimize the data generation process in IoT
systems.
