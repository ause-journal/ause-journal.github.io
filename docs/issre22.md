## About

Welcome to the "Automated Software Engineering" journal special issue on â€œThe 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2022)." We selected for the special issue a subset of the best papers of the conference that intersect with the topics of the journal, and that are suitable for an extended version with new contents. All the invited extended papers will be evaluated on their own merits, as there is no fixed target acceptance rate for the special issue. All papers will undergo a peer-review process to assure the quality and the originality of the research, and to evaluate whether the paper includes sufficient new material compared to the original paper presented at ISSRE 2022. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. We expect that the journal submissions should contain a substantial scientific contribution, e.g., in the form of technical material, including new ideas, theories and/or experimentation and that neither verbatim transfer of large parts of the conference paper nor reproduction of already published figures will be tolerated. The extended versions of ISSRE papers will undergo the standard, rigorous journal review process and be accepted only if well-suited to the topic of this special issue and meeting the scientific level of the journal. Final decisions on all papers are made by the Editor-in-Chief.
