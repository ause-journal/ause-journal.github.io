# Call for papers, Green and Sustainable Software
{: .fs-9 }

Description, including a list of topics covered:
The engineering of green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a
sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green
principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and
self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy
consumption. Moreover, software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability
issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and
measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and
green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and
effect change. Analysis of the sustainability of a specific software system requires
software that aids developers in weighing the four dimensions of
sustainability---economic, social, environmental, and technical---with their attendant
trade-offs. The software engineering community must assume leadership in this
important challenge. In this workshop, we will explore the theme of “green software
engineering for software sustainability” with a goal towards creating actionable
outcomes that will affect how software engineering is practiced and taught in the future,
in order to help organizations prioritize their sustainability objectives.

Topics:
-  Energy-efficient choices for architecture and design patterns, algorithms, data
structures, programming languages, language runtime and infrastructure.
- Architectural implications (architectural tactics, architectural styles, design
patterns and anti-patterns) for green and sustainable software
- Practices for sustainability-aware software engineering
- Metrics and measures for sustainability-aware software engineering
- Sustainability-aware architectures in context (e.g., cloud-edge continuum)
- Teaching and training of skills and competencies in sustainability-aware software
engineering
- Sustainable computing from a software engineering and software-intensive
system perspective
- Applied, or experimented with, software engineering methodologies at all levels
(from requirements elicitation to architecture design, coding, testing, and
maintenance)
- Meta-analyses, and syntheses of studies to build theories on green and
sustainable software; conceptual reflections related to software sustainability
- Progress on the various dimensions of software sustainability and their interplay
- Software adaptation for sustainability
- Tools to support sustainability-aware decision-making
- Sustainability of emerging computing technologies (AI systems, edge devices,
generative AI-enabled applications)
- Green AI, lighter, less data-intensive, and less energy-consuming AI models and
architectures
- Sustainable Large Language Models (LLMs) for software code
- Green Agentic AI
- Reduction of software organizations’ compute-heavy workloads
- Cloud and energy efficiency
- Standards on the environmental sustainability of software and AI software
