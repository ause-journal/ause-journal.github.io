# Call for papers, Extended Papers from APSEC 2024 
{: .fs-9}

It has been 31 years since the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) as a leading regional conference that gathers researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to exchange knowledge and best practices in software engineering, and to address emerging challenges and solutions in software engineering innovation. This yearâ€™s APSEC will be held on December 3-6, 2024 in Chongqing, China. APSEC 2024 will continue in the tradition of previous editions of this regional conference. As in past APSEC series, the main research track features the most recent and significant innovations in the field of software engineering and all its sub-disciplines. More details can be found at the homepage: [https://conf.researchr.org/home/apsec-2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/apsec-2024). In this year, we want to organize a special issue on AUSE.
