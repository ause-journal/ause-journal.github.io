# Call for papers, Special Issue for the ASYDE Workshop@ASE 2025 
{: .fs-9 }

## Name of the call: Automated, Verifiable, and Generative Approaches to Software Engineering

The increasing complexity, dynamism, and scale of modern software systems have intensified the demand for advanced forms of automation throughout the software development lifecycle. The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with architectural and methodological advances such as multi-agent systems, has introduced transformative opportunities for automated analysis, synthesis, verification, and maintenance of software. Simultaneously, the growing importance of correctness, adaptability, and trustworthiness in software-intensive systems underscores the need for rigorous verification and validation frameworks that can seamlessly integrate with automated engineering workflows.

This Special Issue invites high-quality submissions that explore the foundations, methods, and tools required to advance automated, verifiable, and generative approaches to software engineering. We seek contributions offering novel scientific insights, innovative engineering solutions, extensive empirical studies, and significant technological advancements that foster deeper integration between automation, AI-driven engineering, and formal verification. Interdisciplinary works that connect software engineering with artificial intelligence, distributed systems, human–AI collaboration, and cyber-physical systems are also welcome.

By bringing together perspectives on automated synthesis, rigorous verification, agent-based collaboration, and generative modeling, this Special Issue aims to showcase emerging research that can shape the future of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable software systems.
