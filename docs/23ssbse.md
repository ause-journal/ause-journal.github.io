# Call for papers, Advances in Search-Based Software Engineering
{: .fs-9 }

Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) is a research area focused on the formulation of
software engineering problems as search problems, and the subsequent use of complex
heuristic techniques to attain optimal solutions to such problems. A wealth of engineering
challenges - from test generation, to design refactoring, to process organization - can be solved
efficiently through the application of automated optimization techniques. SBSE is a growing
field - sitting at the crossroads between AI, machine learning, and software engineering - and
SBSE techniques have begun to attain human-competitive results.

We   invite the submission of high quality
papers describing novel and original work in all areas of SBSE including, but not limited to,
applications of SBSE to novel problems, theoretical analyses of search algorithms for software
engineering, rigorous empirical evaluations of SBSE techniques, and reports of industrial
experiences.

We also make a special invitation to well-reviewed papers from the 15th SSBSE meeting (San Francisco, December 2023).
Each such  paper would be
expected to have a new title and significant new content (at least 30% delta between the
conference and journal papers). Papers would be required to discuss the original paper and the
extensions explicitly.

Topics for this special edition will include (but not limited to):

- Applications of search-based techniques throughout the software engineering lifecycle
- Theoretical analyses of search algorithms
- Exact operational research techniques to nature-inspired algorithms, local search
metaheuristics, and simulated annealing.
- Reports on software engineering applications to which SBSE has not been applied
before.
