# Call for papers, AUSE Anniversary Issue: 30 years of AUSE.
{: .fs-9 }

**Submission is by invitation only.**

2024 marks the 30th anniversary of the AUSE journal. To celebrate, we are arranging a special issue where we invite the authors of highly-cited AUSE articles to offer a retrospective on the field that their original article was related to.

Specifically, submissions should cover:
- What did the authors achieve?
    - This includes a summary of the original article, as well as an examination of the impact of that work (e.g., how did the original work inspire citing papers).
- What has changed in the broader research field of the original paper since it was published?
- What are the research challenges in the broader research field of the original paper that should be tackled in the next 5,10,15,30 years? 

## Page Length

- Retrosepctives can be as short as 3 pages.
- Longer papers are welcome, as long as their content offers a deep understanding of that area of research.

## Deadline

30 June 2024
