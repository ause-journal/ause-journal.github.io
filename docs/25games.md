-   Artificial intelligence for software engineering applied to games.
-   Software engineering for artificial intelligence in games.
-   Debugging and fault localization applied to games.
-   Distributed and collaborative software engineering for game development.
-   Empirical software engineering applied to games.
-   Human and social aspects of software engineering in game development.
-   Human-computer interaction in games.
-   Mining software repositories for game development insights.
-   Mobile game development.
-   Model-driven engineering applied to games.
-   Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems in games.
-   Performance engineering for games.
-   Program analysis for games.

{: .warning }  
> As of Dec 2024, the following two special rules will apply. <br>(1) Submissions are no longer allowed, generated from Msword (submit pdfs generated from the
[Springer Latex template files](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/18782940/data/v11)). For authors unfamilar with Latex, we use and recommend the on-line tool [http://overleaf.com](overleaf.com). <br>
(2) Use of the NASA data sets from the 1990s (PC1, JM1, etc) is no longer acceptable. Please use tools like (e.g.) CommitGuru to mine (e.g.) Github to find data.
