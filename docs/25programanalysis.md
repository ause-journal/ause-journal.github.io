# Call for papers, Effective Program Analysis and Testing for Modern Software Development
{: .fs-9 }

Modern software systems are complex, and they evolve rapidly. It is key but challenging to ensure that modern software is of high quality. Software analysis and testing techniques are crucial for quality assurance. They are used throughout the software development process, covering areas such as bug finding, vulnerability detection, fault localization, security analysis, testing, and debugging. Recent intelligence-based approaches provide new opportunities and solutions for effective software development. Research of analysis and testing techniques for modern software development is of great scientific and practical value, as it provides important means for software quality enhancement. 

## Aims and Scope
This special issue is aimed at addressing core challenges for modern software development with a focus on attracting methodological and technical solutions for the analysis and testing of modern software. We hope to bring together expertise of software analysis and testing from both academia and industry for the quality assurance and enhancement of modern software. 

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 

- Program analysis 
- Software testing 
- Fault localization
- Program repair and debugging
- Vulnerability detection
- Fuzzing
- Security analysis
- Automated test generation
- Performance testing and analysis
- Human factors in testing 


## Deadline

Submission deadline: Jan 31st, 2025 

Review deadline: Mar 14th, 2025 

Author revision: Apr 25th, 2025 

Final notification: May 16th, 2025

## How to Submit

Submitted papers should present original, unpublished work, relevant to one of the topics of the Special Issue.
